Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) is a reactive routing protocol of Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET). Since AODV does not have any security mechanism it leads to network layered attacks which in turn degrades MANETâ€™s performance. Secure and efficient
routing is a needed for various commercial and non-commercial applications of MANET including military and war, disaster and earthquake, and riot control. The performance analysis of AODV protocol is carried out under the influence of each designed attack by using the
network simulator. Simulation results show that, the network layer attacks affect packet delivery ability of AODV protocol with low energy consumption and in short time. Design of attacks helps to understand attacks behaviour and to develop security mechanism in AODV.
